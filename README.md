# Magic The Gathering Life Counter

Simple React Native app allowing up to 4 players to track there life totals while plying Magic the Gathering.

I built this to try out React Native instead of building a toDo list because who needs to build another to do list ðŸ˜„.

It has morphed into a kinda fun side project.

Built with TS, React Native, and Expo
